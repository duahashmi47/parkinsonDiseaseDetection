# parkinsonDiseaseDetection
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to detect Parkinson’s Disease using biomedical voice measurements. Parkinson’s Disease affects motor function, and subtle changes in voice can serve as early indicators. The goal is to classify whether a patient has Parkinson’s based on a set of vocal biomarker features.
